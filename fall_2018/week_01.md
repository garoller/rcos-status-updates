## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I wasn't able to do much work this past week for Petitions, because I was attending the Grace Hopper Celebration. In the past few weeks though, I made the basic structure for the new petitions site in Django.   

## This Week's Plan

> We are starting our petitions work meetings this week. I need to map out what is required for a MVP, and the petitions members can decide what feature they want to work on if they haven't already. I will also pick up whatever features are left to work on. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I have limited experience with Django but am excited to learn more about it.
