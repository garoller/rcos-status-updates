## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I am giving a late status update for Week 2. I worked on switching where the secret key is read in from. Previously, we were reading it in from a JSON file, but we decided to switch it to something more standard in Django. I made a `secrets.py` to store the secret key. I also started a branch to add to change the `.gitignore` and need to finish that.

## This Week's Plan

> I need to switch the way we are reading in the secret key, to just read from an environment variable and finish and open the PR to update the `.gitignore`.

## Anything Blocking?

> Not as of now!
