## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I have not been writing as many status updates as I should have, so I am going to wrap up and give some detail in this last one. 

> Work meetings: I held weekly work meeting at the Wednesday bonus sessions this semester, and it was great because a lot of the members came to work and ask questions. A lot of members asked Git questions, specifically about branching, how to update a branch, etc. Also, there have been a few other times in the last week and a half where people have asked questions about forking and how to update a fork. My goal is to have a Git bonus session ready by the beginning of next semester, that goes over the basics, but also goes over branching and forking, to try to avoid some of these issues next semester.

> Petitions: This semseter, I mainly worked on the [landing page](https://github.com/wtg/petitions-rewrite/tree/landing-page). It was a lot of fun, and I am looking forward to working more on the front end next semester and over break. I also worked with the HCI group. They were extremely helpful, and there reports can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/wtg/petitions-rewrite/wiki). I wish the rewrite would have been further along, so we could have gotten feedback on the new usability. Additionally, I began making a Developer Guide, with Git and Django tutorials, so I can direct new contributors there.

> Other contributions: I have also been reviewing and merging in pull requests both for Petitions and the Shuttle Tracker. I have been able to learn a lot from this, although I don't really enjoy it. I often found myself taking way too long to complete a review, and I need to continue to do this so I can get better at doing an efficient, thourough review. I also worked on the [WebTech survey platform](https://github.com/wtg/senate-survey) to release the fall 2018 Senate survey. I had worked with the survey platform last spring, but I learned even more about it this fall. I am happy that I have that experience now, so I am able to document that and pass it on to the next chair.
