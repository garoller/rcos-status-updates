## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I spent most of the time changing the database settings and instructions to use a database url and opening the PR for the front end base branch.


## This Week's Plan

> Fix style on the index page, mainly the way the cards are styled and laid out. I also would like to get some feedback from other group members on the overall style of the index page. 

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking.
