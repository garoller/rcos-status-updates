## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I worked on adding the database migrations and changing the landing page to incorporate the model. I also add a basic form for creating a petition, mainly to demonstrate how to use forms in Django. The create page needs a lot more work, but I think another group member could work on this. 

> I also reviewed and approved a PR for models in petitions. That is merged in now, which is great, because this will provide a larger foundation for other group members to work off of.

> I reviewed and approved 2 PRs on the shuttle tracker this week as well.

## This Week's Plan

> I'm going to continue work on the landing page, and my goal for this week is to remove the hard-coded values I used as examples from this page.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking.
