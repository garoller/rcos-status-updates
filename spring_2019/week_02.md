## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I added an admin view for the Petition object. This is mainly going to be used for development to create petition objects. I spend most of my time trying to remove the hard code values from the landing page. I was having some trouble when I returned all of the Petition objects from the django view to the template. I was getting an error, because I wasn't handling a ManyToManyField inside of the Petition model correctly. It took me a while to recognize this issue, but it is fixed now. I also changed the style slightly for the grid view of petitions on the landing page.


## This Week's Plan

> Finish up my work for the front end base, and open a PR.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking.
